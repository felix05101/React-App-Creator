# App Creator

App Creator is a fun little command-line tool written in C# that helps you kickstart React and React Native projects with ease!

## Usage

1. **Create a React app:**
    ```
    new react myapp
    ```

2. **Create a React Native app:**
    ```
    new reactnative myapp
    ```

3. **Exit the application:**

    exit
    ```

That's it! Just replace `myapp` with your desired app name. Happy coding!
