# App Creator

App Creator is a tiny command-line tool written in C# that helps you kickstart React and React Native projects with ease!

It creates a new project on your desktop, opens it in Visual Studio Code, starts the development Server and opens the preview in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Create a React app:**
    ```
    new react myapp
    ```

2. **Create a React Native app:**
    ```
    new reactnative myapp
    ```

3. **Exit the application:**
    ```
    exit
    ```

That's it! Just replace `myapp` with your desired app name. Happy coding!
